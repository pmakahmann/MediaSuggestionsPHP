This is my first PHP website.  It was altered and updated from a Treehouse Course Project.  I have added my own personal selections, supplemented genres, and altered the CSS more to my liking.

To Run:
Since the PHP requires server hosting, you can either:
1. Clone the repo and run in locally with MAMP or its equivalent, or
2. Visit www.roguemiddlechild.com/MediaSuggestions

Thanks for checking out my work.  My next step is to remove the data.php file and have the data pulled from a mySQL database.
