This is my first PHP website.  It was altered and updated from a Treehouse Course Project.  I have added my own personal selections, supplemented genres, and altered the CSS more to my liking.

Currently, there is an issue with several images loading on mobile devices.  This is currently being addressed.

To Run:
Since the PHP requires server hosting, you can either:
1. Clone the repo and run in locally with MAMP or its equivalent, or
2. Visit www.roguemiddlechild.com/MediaSuggestions

Thanks for checking out my work.  My next step is to remove the data.php file and have the data pulled from a mySQL database.
